### Style guide
Consistent indentation
Always close braces on their own line
Good naming of variables and functions
Add comments, preferably on docstrings
  Use template provided by /**   (vs Code)
    Example:
    /**
    * Opens a connection to the database
    * @param {number} num amount of whatever
    * @param {string} adsf username
    */

### Git Rules
Always make clear what file you're working on
Small commits
Good descriptive msg (but short!)

Always work on a feature branch
Before making a pull request:
  Pull master onto your branch and merge it
  Fix any errors or conflicts
  THEN make the pull request to master
If working on a new feature then create a new branch

Everyone should have its code reviewed before getting accepted, even the git master

### Communication

Standups:
  Before starting the day: 10-15'
  Every 4 hours: 5-10'

Be willing to pause your work and help others with roadblocks
Maximun stuck time: 30'-1hr

Document roadblocks and their solution on the chat
